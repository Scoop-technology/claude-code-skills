# Claude Code Skills & Commands

Reusable Claude Code skills and commands for agile project management and development workflows.

## What's the Difference?

- **Commands**: Simple markdown files that create slash commands (e.g., `/commit`, `/pr`, `/lint`) - user-triggered entry points
- **Skills**: Directories with SKILL.md files containing workflow methodology - can auto-trigger and provide reusable blueprints

## Available Skills

- **requirements-design** - Gather requirements and create world-class design documentation
- **git-workflow** - GitFlow branching strategy and commit conventions
- **agile-board** - Board-specific implementation (ZenHub/Jira/Linear)
- **project-management** - Story templates, estimation, sprint planning, epic planning
- **developer-analysis** - Engineering analysis before implementation
- **testing** - Testing strategy, coverage analysis, and quality assurance

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository

Clone this repository to wherever you keep your projects:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd claude-code-skills
```

### 2. Run the install script

The install script creates symlinks from `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/commands/` to the directories/files in this repository.

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./install.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

Windows requires admin privileges to create symbolic links (or Developer Mode enabled). Follow these steps:

**Option 1: Run PowerShell as Administrator (Recommended for first-time setup)**
1. Right-click the Windows Start button → Select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Terminal (Admin)"
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   - In VS Code, right-click the `install.ps1` file → "Copy Path"
   - In PowerShell Admin: `cd "C:\path\you\copied"`
3. Run the install script:
   ```powershell
   .\install.ps1
   ```

**Option 2: Enable Developer Mode (No admin needed for future installs)**
1. Settings → Privacy & Security → For developers
2. Enable "Developer Mode"
3. Restart PowerShell (no admin needed)
4. Navigate to the repository and run:
   ```powershell
   cd path\to\claude-code-skills
   .\install.ps1
   ```

### 3. Update skills

To get the latest skill updates:

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-code-skills
git pull
```

The symlinks ensure Claude Code immediately uses the updated skills and commands.

## What Gets Installed

The install script:
1. Creates `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/commands/` directories if they don't exist
2. Symlinks each skill directory from `skills/` into `~/.claude/skills/`
3. Symlinks each command file from `commands/` into `~/.claude/commands/`
4. Makes skills and commands available globally for all your projects
5. Skills auto-load when relevant, commands are invoked with slash syntax (e.g., `/commit`)

## Per-Project Setup

### Agile Board Configuration

After installing skills, configure the agile board for each project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
python /path/to/claude-code-skills/skills/agile-board/scripts/setup.py
```

This creates a project-local `.claude/agile-board-config.json` with your board settings.

## Available Commands

Commands are lightweight slash commands for common development tasks:

- **requirements-design** - Gather requirements and create design documentation
- **commit** - Create commits following conventions
- **branch** - Create branches with proper naming
- **pr** - Create pull requests
- **pr-review** - Review pull requests
- **security-scan** - Run security scans
- **lint** - Run linting
- **lint-setup** - Setup linting and pre-commit hooks
- **format** - Format code
- **story** - Create user stories
- **story-start** - Start work on a story
- **comment** - Add comment to current story ticket

## Skills Overview

### git-workflow

GitFlow branching model with commit conventions and automated quality checks.

**Automatically triggers when:** Creating branches, writing commits, creating PRs, setting up linting/pre-commit hooks, questions about code quality automation

**Key features:**
- Branch naming: `feature/epic-X-story-Y.Z-description`
- Commit format: `type(scope): description`
- PR templates and review checklist
- **One-command linting setup** - Automated script detects languages and configures pre-commit hooks
- Pre-commit hooks for automated formatting and linting
- Multi-layer quality checks (IDE → Pre-commit → CI)
- Language-specific configs (Python, TypeScript, C#, Flutter, Terraform)

### agile-board

Board-specific implementation for creating and managing issues.

**Automatically triggers when:** Creating issues, managing sprints, updating ticket status

**Supported boards:**
- ZenHub (with MCP integration)
- Jira (REST API)
- Linear (GraphQL)

**Requires setup:** Run `setup.py` once per project to configure board type and credentials.

### project-management

Board-agnostic agile workflows for refining stories and planning sprints.

**Automatically triggers when:** Refining user stories, creating acceptance criteria, estimating story points, planning sprints or epics

**Key features:**
- Story refinement (takes high-level stories from requirements-design, adds AC and estimates)
- Story templates (feature, bug, technical)
- T-shirt sizing (XS=1, S=3, M=5, L=8, XL=13)
- Acceptance criteria best practices
- Sprint workflows (planning, retrospectives, velocity tracking)
- Epic planning and story dependencies
- Release planning across multiple epics

**Integration:**
- Takes initial story list from `/requirements-design` → adds detailed AC, estimates, creates tickets

### developer-analysis

Engineering analysis before implementation.

**Automatically triggers when:** Starting work on a story, analyzing requirements, creating POC scripts for integrations, proposing technical design, reconciling with existing architecture

**Key features:**
- Requirements analysis and ambiguity identification
- POC script creation for third-party integrations
- Technical design proposals for user approval
- Architecture reconciliation
- Proactive use before implementation to reduce rework

### testing

Testing strategy, coverage analysis, and quality assurance.

**Automatically triggers when:** Planning test strategy, analyzing coverage, reviewing test quality in PRs, creating mocks for integrations, defining testing standards

**Key features:**
- Test strategy planning for stories
- Coverage analysis and reporting
- PR review test verification
- Integration mocking patterns
- Testing standards definition
- Referenced by developer-analysis and git-workflow skills

### requirements-design

Comprehensive requirements gathering and design documentation creation.

**Automatically triggers when:** Starting a new project or feature, gathering requirements, creating design documentation

**Key features:**
- **Active architecture guidance** - Challenges assumptions, researches alternatives, suggests improvements
- **Five core documents** - Constraints, Customer Value, Solution Design, Requirements, Architecture
- **Multiple approaches** - Customer-First, Technical-First, or Parallel document creation
- **Initial story decomposition** - Break requirements into epics and high-level stories (handoff to project-management for refinement)
- **Technical pointers** - Specs, patterns, code references for implementation
- **Working Backwards** - Amazon methodology for customer-driven design
- **Reusability focus** - Design for abstraction and portability across organizations

**Integration:**
- Creates requirements → handoff to `/project-management` for detailed story refinement (AC, estimation, sprint planning)
- Creates NFRs → handoff to `/testing` for test strategy
- Creates API contracts → handoff to `/developer-analysis` for POCs and mocks

## How Skills Work Together

**Example:** "Create a story for implementing dark mode"

Claude automatically:
1. Loads `project-management` skill → Story structure, acceptance criteria, estimate
2. Loads `agile-board` skill → Board-specific creation (checks your config)
3. Uses board's MCP tools or API to create the issue
4. Applies proper formatting, estimates, and links to epics

## What's Version Controlled

✅ **Committed:**
- SKILL.md files
- Reference documentation
- Setup scripts
- Install scripts
- Example configurations

❌ **Not committed (.gitignore):**
- `config.json` files (contain workspace IDs, API tokens)
- Credentials or secrets

## Building for Distribution

Run the build script to produce all distributable archives:

```bash
python3 build.py
```

This produces two types of output in `dist/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dist/claude-code-skills-{version}.zip` | Full distribution for **Claude Code** (CLI) |
| `dist/skills/agile-board.zip` | Individual skill for **Claude Desktop** upload |
| `dist/skills/developer-analysis.zip` | Individual skill for **Claude Desktop** upload |
| `dist/skills/git-workflow.zip` | Individual skill for **Claude Desktop** upload |
| `dist/skills/project-management.zip` | Individual skill for **Claude Desktop** upload |
| `dist/skills/requirements-design.zip` | Individual skill for **Claude Desktop** upload |
| `dist/skills/testing.zip` | Individual skill for **Claude Desktop** upload |

Only committed, tracked files are included (uses `git archive` / `git ls-files`). The `--dirty` suffix in the version string indicates uncommitted changes are present.

**Common options:**

```bash
python3 build.py                        # Build everything (auto-version)
python3 build.py --version v1.2.0       # Override version string
python3 build.py --list                 # Preview files before building
python3 build.py --output /tmp/release  # Custom output directory
```

> **Note:** Run `git commit` before building to include your latest changes.

**Installing from the zip:**

```bash
# Claude Code — Linux / Mac
unzip claude-code-skills-*.zip -d claude-code-skills
cd claude-code-skills && bash install.sh

# Claude Code — Windows (PowerShell)

## Contributing

### Guidelines

**CRITICAL: Keep everything generic and portable!**

This repository is designed to be reusable across organizations and projects. When contributing:

✅ **DO:**
- Use generic placeholders: `your-org`, `my-org`, `your-repo`, `system-requirements.md`
- Use generic bucket names: `content-store`, `knowledge-search`
- Use generic examples that apply to any team or organization
- Document patterns and best practices, not specific implementations
- Test that skills work across different contexts
- **Ensure cross-platform compatibility**: Skills MUST work on Linux, Mac, and Windows

❌ **DON'T:**
- Include organization names (company names, client names, team names)
- Reference specific project names or codenames
- Include real bucket names, account IDs, or resource names
- Add examples tied to a specific business domain
- Commit any secrets, credentials, or environment-specific configs

### Adding or Updating Skills

1. Make changes to skills in your local clone
2. Test changes locally (symlinked skills in `~/.claude/skills/` update immediately)
3. Verify no organization-specific references: `git grep -i "yourorg\|clientname"`
4. Commit and push changes
5. Team members run `git pull` in their clone to get updates

### Example Contributions

**Good example** (generic):
```markdown
Configure AWS SSO:
```bash
aws configure sso
# SSO session name: my-org
# SSO start URL: https://your-org.awsapps.com/start
```

**Bad example** (organization-specific):
```markdown
Configure AWS SSO:
```bash
aws configure sso
# SSO session name: acme-corp
# SSO start URL: https://acme-corp.awsapps.com/start
```

### Security and Privacy

**Before committing:**

1. **No secrets or credentials**
   - Never commit API keys, passwords, tokens, or certificates
   - Use `.env.example` files with placeholder values only
   - Real configs go in `.gitignore`d files

2. **Review for sensitive information**
   - No IP addresses, account IDs, or resource ARNs
   - No real email addresses or usernames
   - No internal URLs or endpoint addresses
   - Use `git diff --cached` to review before committing

3. **Git history is permanent**
   - Don't commit and then remove - it stays in history
   - If you accidentally commit secrets, notify maintainers immediately
   - History may need to be rewritten and force-pushed

### Code Quality Standards

**Cross-platform requirement** (MANDATORY):
- **ALL skills MUST work on Linux, Mac, and Windows**
- Test on all three platforms before committing
- Use Python for scripts when possible (cross-platform by default)
- If using shell scripts, provide both `.sh` (Linux/Mac) and `.ps1` (Windows) versions
- Avoid platform-specific commands or file paths

**Python scripts** (e.g., `setup.py`):
- MUST be cross-platform compatible (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Use `pathlib` for file paths, not string concatenation
- Clear error messages and user prompts
- Handle missing dependencies gracefully
- Include docstrings and comments

**Markdown documentation**:
- Use clear headings and structure
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting
- Use tables for comparisons
- Keep line length readable (aim for ~100 chars)
- Show examples for all platforms when commands differ

**Shell scripts**:
- MUST provide both `.sh` (Linux/Mac) and `.ps1` (Windows) versions
- Use `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- Include error handling (`set -e` for bash)
- Test on all target platforms before committing

### Testing Changes

Before pushing:

1. **Test locally**: Verify skills load and work as expected
2. **Check for breakage**: Ensure existing workflows still function
3. **Cross-platform**: Test on Windows if providing scripts
4. **Documentation**: Update README.md if adding new features

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits:

```
feat(skill-name): add new feature
fix(skill-name): correct issue with...
docs(skill-name): update documentation for...
refactor(skill-name): reorganize without changing behavior
chore: update dependencies, tooling, etc.
```

### Breaking Changes

If your change breaks existing functionality:

1. Clearly document the breaking change in commit message
2. Update affected documentation
3. Consider backwards compatibility if feasible
4. Notify team before pushing

### Getting Help

- Review existing skills for examples and patterns
- Open an issue for questions or suggestions
- Discuss major changes before implementing

## Using with Multiple Skill Repositories
