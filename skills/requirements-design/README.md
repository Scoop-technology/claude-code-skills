# Requirements & Design Skill

A comprehensive skill for gathering requirements and creating world-class design documentation that enables effective planning, estimation, and implementation.

**This skill actively challenges assumptions, researches alternatives, and suggests improvements** - it's not a passive order-taker.

## Overview

This skill transforms initial ideas and requirements into interconnected documents:

**Core Documents (All Five Always Created)**:
1. **Constraints** - Project boundaries and guiding principles (always created first)
2. **Customer Value** - Why will we win? Value proposition and competitive advantage
   - Press release, FAQs, customer experience mockups (Working Backwards methodology)
   - Audience: Business stakeholders, product managers, executives, investors
3. **Solution Design** - High-level delivery approach
   - Problem statement, solution overview, design decisions, architecture philosophy
   - Audience: Technical stakeholders, architects, engineering teams, product managers
4. **Requirements** - Detailed specifications (WHAT to build)
   - Comprehensive functional/non-functional requirements, user stories
5. **Architecture** - Technical blueprint (HOW to implement)
   - Component diagrams, system design, API contracts, data flows

**Why All Five?**
- **Consistency**: Same structure across all projects
- **Different Audiences**: Customer Value for business, Solution Design bridges both worlds, Requirements/Architecture for technical teams
- **Complete Picture**: Value proposition + Delivery approach + Detailed specs + Implementation blueprint

Additionally, the skill can help:
- **Challenge requirements**: Question vague, inconsistent, or suboptimal requirements
- **Research alternatives**: Use web search and codebase analysis to find better approaches
- **Suggest improvements**: Present 2-3 options with detailed pros/cons/costs
- Break requirements into epics and user stories
- Provide technical pointers (specs, patterns, code references)
- Estimate effort for stories
- Create working backwards documents (Amazon methodology)

## What Makes This Skill World-Class

This skill is based on real-world documentation from successful projects (like the SharePoint search service) and incorporates best practices for:

### Active Architecture Guidance
- **Challenges Assumptions**: Questions vague requirements, stated solutions vs problems
- **Researches Actively**: Uses WebSearch for best practices, Grep for codebase patterns
- **Suggests Alternatives**: Presents 2-3 options with cost/complexity comparisons
- **Asks "Why" Repeatedly**: Digs to root problems using 5 Whys technique
- **Validates Feasibility**: Checks if timelines, costs, scale are realistic

### Documentation Quality
- **Visual Communication**: ASCII diagrams, data flows, component diagrams
- **Decision Rationale**: Every significant choice is explained with alternatives considered
- **Concrete Examples**: JSON schemas, API requests/responses, code patterns
- **Cost & Performance Analysis**: Actual numbers with projections
- **Progressive Detail**: High-level overview → component details → implementation
- **User-Centric Perspective**: "Before and after" comparisons, benefit-focused
- **Future-Proofing**: Extensible designs, multi-phase planning
- **Operational Excellence**: Monitoring, observability, incident handling built-in

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when**:
- Starting a new project or feature
- Have initial requirements but need structure
- Need to document an existing system
- Want to break down requirements into implementable pieces
- Need to estimate effort for planning
- Want to align stakeholders on approach

**Skip this skill if**:
- Requirements are already fully documented
- You just need to implement a small, well-defined feature
- You're only doing research/exploration (use explore agent instead)

## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. Invoke the skill: `/requirements-design`
2. Answer questions about your project
3. Review and iterate on generated documents
4. Optionally create story breakdowns

### Typical Workflow

**Phase 0: Review Existing Documentation** (If applicable, 15-30 minutes)
- Skill asks if you have existing requirements or documentation
- If yes, provide the location/path to existing docs
- Skill reads and analyzes existing content
- Identifies gaps, inconsistencies, or areas needing clarification
- Proposes how to incorporate existing content into new document structure

**Phase 1: Capture Constraints** (15-30 minutes)
- **Always first**: Identify non-negotiable requirements
- Document platform mandates, compliance, budget, timeline, architecture principles
- Creates foundation for all recommendations

**Phase 2: Requirements Gathering** (30-60 minutes)
- Discuss project context, problems, goals
- Identify users and stakeholders
- Explore technical constraints
- Define scope and priorities

**Phase 3: Document Creation** (All Five Documents Always Created)

The skill will recommend an approach that determines **document creation order**, not which documents to create:

**Approach A: Customer-First** (When Value Proposition Needs Clarity)
- Order: Constraints → Customer Value → Solution Design → Requirements → Architecture
- Best for: Greenfield products, unclear value proposition, need stakeholder buy-in
- Start by articulating why customers will choose this, then translate to delivery approach

**Approach B: Technical-First** (When Delivery Approach is Clear)
- Order: Constraints → Solution Design → Customer Value → Requirements → Architecture
- Best for: Clear requirements, technical projects, established products
- Start with delivery approach and design decisions, then frame the customer value

**Approach C: Parallel** (When Time is Critical)
- Order: Constraints → [Customer Value + Solution Design] → Requirements → Architecture
- Best for: Experienced teams, well-understood domain, tight timelines
- Develop both vision documents simultaneously

**All approaches create the same five documents** - only the order and emphasis differ.

**Result**: Every project gets complete documentation with both customer value proposition and high-level delivery approach.

**Phase 4: Story Decomposition** (Optional, 1-2 hours)
- Break requirements into epics (5-10 major feature areas)
- Decompose epics into initial story backlog (high-level stories)
- Document dependencies and sequencing
- Create epic catalog structure
- **Handoff to `/project-management`** for story refinement (acceptance criteria, estimation, sprint planning)

**Phase 5: Technical Pointers** (Optional, ongoing)
- Add specs and standards references
- Identify implementation patterns
- Link to similar code in codebase
- Provide testing strategies

## How the Skill Challenges & Researches

This skill is **actively challenging, not passively documenting**. It:

### 1. Challenges Assumptions
- Questions vague requirements ("build a dashboard" → "What problem does it solve?")
- Challenges technology choices ("we need Redis" → "What are you caching? What's your scale?")
- Identifies over-engineering ("we need Kubernetes" for 3 services → suggests simpler alternatives)
- Validates feasibility (cost, timeline, operational overhead)

### 2. Researches Proactively
- **WebSearch**: Industry best practices, technology comparisons, cost estimates
- **Grep/Read**: Existing patterns in your codebase
- **Task (Explore)**: Understand codebase architecture
- Presents 2-3 researched options with pros/cons/costs

### 3. Suggests Better Alternatives
- Simpler solutions (in-memory cache vs Redis for small scale)
- Cost-effective approaches (SaaS vs build)
- Industry standards (SAML/OIDC abstraction vs vendor-specific)

### 4. Validates Feasibility
- **Cost reality checks**: "That approach costs $50K/month at your scale. Here's a $5K alternative"
- **Timeline reality checks**: "That's a 6-month project. Here's what's possible in 6 weeks"
- **Technical reality checks**: "10ms latency across continents isn't possible. Here's what is"

## Output Structure

By default, documents are created in `docs/Design/`:

```
docs/Design/
├── 01-constraints-{project-name}.md         # 1. Project Boundaries
├── 02-customer-value-{project-name}.md      # 2. Why Will We Win?
├── 03-solution-design-{project-name}.md     # 3. High-Level Delivery Approach
├── 04-requirements-{project-name}.md        # 4. Detailed Specifications

```

**All five documents are always created** for consistency and completeness.

**Document Creation Order** (varies by approach chosen):
- **Customer-First**: Constraints → Customer Value → Solution Design → Requirements → Architecture
- **Technical-First**: Constraints → Solution Design → Customer Value → Requirements → Architecture
- **Parallel**: Constraints → [Customer Value + Solution Design] → Requirements → Architecture

You can specify a different location if preferred.

## Story Decomposition (Initial Breakdown)

This skill helps with **initial decomposition** during requirements phase. For **detailed story management** (templates, acceptance criteria, estimation, sprint planning), use `/project-management` skill.

### Epic Structure

Epics represent major feature areas:
- Epic 0: Foundation/Infrastructure
- Epic 1-N: Core features
- Epic N+1: Operational capabilities

**Typical project has 5-10 epics**

### Initial Story List

During requirements phase, create high-level story lists:
- User story format (As a... I want... So that...)
- High-level scope description
- Dependencies on other stories

**Typical epic has 5-15 stories**

### Handoff to Project Management

After creating epic catalog with initial story list:
1. Use `/project-management` to refine stories with:
   - Detailed acceptance criteria (checkbox format)
   - T-shirt sizing estimates (XS/S/M/L/XL)
   - Technical notes and Definition of Done
2. Use `/agile-board` to create stories on board
3. Use `/project-management` for sprint planning

## Technical Pointers

For each story, provide:

1. **Specifications**: Links to relevant standards (OAuth 2.0, OpenAPI, etc.)
2. **Implementation Patterns**: Design patterns that apply
3. **Code References**: Similar implementations in codebase (with file:line references)
4. **External Resources**: Official docs, tutorials, examples
5. **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, E2E, performance, security tests
6. **Performance Considerations**: Targets, optimizations, monitoring
7. **Security Considerations**: Concerns, mitigations, testing

## Working Backwards Process

The skill supports Amazon's "Working Backwards" methodology:

1. **Press Release**: Write customer-facing announcement
2. **FAQs**: Answer customer and internal questions
3. **Customer Experience**: Mock up user journeys
4. **User Manual**: Draft how customers will use it
5. **Map to Implementation**: Connect customer needs to technical requirements

This approach ensures customer value drives technical decisions.

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works well with:

- **developer-analysis**: Use requirements to create technical design before implementation
- **project-management**: Use story breakdowns for sprint planning
- **testing**: Use acceptance criteria to define test strategy
- **git-workflow**: Use architecture to understand branching strategy
