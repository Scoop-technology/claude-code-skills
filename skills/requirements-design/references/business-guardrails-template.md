## Purpose of This Document

This is the **(1) Business Guardrails** document — the first of the five core requirements-and-design documents. It captures the **non-negotiable guardrails** and **guiding principles** for this project. These guardrails define the boundaries within which design and implementation decisions must be made.

**Key Distinction**:
- ✅ **Guardrails** (Non-Negotiable): Must be respected, documented here
- ℹ️ **Preferences** (Flexible): Can be challenged, documented separately

---

## Summary

**Critical Guardrails**:
1. [Most important guardrail, e.g., "Must use Azure"]
2. [Second most important, e.g., "Must launch by Q2 2026"]
3. [Third most important, e.g., "Budget cap: $100K"]

**Flexibility Level**: [Low | Medium | High]
- Low: Most decisions are constrained
- Medium: Some flexibility within boundaries
- High: Few hard guardrails, mostly principles

## Non-Negotiable Guardrails

### 1. Platform & Infrastructure Guardrails

#### Guardrail: [Platform Mandate]

**Description**: [e.g., "All services must run on Azure"]

**Type**: Platform Mandate | Technology Standard | Infrastructure Requirement

**Rationale**:
- [Why this constraint exists, e.g., "Enterprise agreement with Microsoft"]
- [Business/technical reason, e.g., "Existing infrastructure and team expertise"]
- [Who decided and when, e.g., "Enterprise Architecture decision, Jan 2025"]

**Impact on Design**:
- [How this affects architecture, e.g., "All cloud services must be Azure-native"]
- [What we can't do, e.g., "Cannot use AWS services"]
- [What we must do, e.g., "Must use Azure Container Apps for hosting"]

**Flexibility**: None | Limited | Exception Process Available
- [If flexible, explain process, e.g., "Can request exception via Architecture Review Board (6-week process, rarely approved)"]
- [If none, state clearly: "This is absolute - no exceptions"]

**Verification**:
- How to check compliance: [e.g., "All infrastructure code must use Azure Resource Manager templates"]
- Who validates: [e.g., "Cloud Engineering team reviews all deployments"]

---

#### Guardrail: [Technology Standard]

**Description**: [e.g., "Only Python, TypeScript, and Java are approved languages"]

**Type**: Technology Standard | Security Policy | Compliance Requirement

**Rationale**:
- [e.g., "Team expertise - all developers proficient in these languages"]
- [e.g., "Hiring pipeline - recruiters screen for these skills"]
- [e.g., "Tooling support - CI/CD, security scanning configured for these"]

**Impact on Design**:
- [Can use: Python, TypeScript, Java]
- [Cannot use: Go, Rust, Ruby, etc.]
- [Must justify: Any new frameworks or major libraries]

**Flexibility**: Limited
- [Exception process if available]
- [Timeline for exceptions, e.g., "Architecture review: 2-3 weeks"]
- [Approval criteria, e.g., "Must show significant benefit + training plan"]

**Verification**:
- Automated checks: [e.g., "CI/CD pipeline rejects non-approved languages"]
- Code review: [e.g., "Tech leads verify during PR review"]

---

### 2. Architecture Principles

#### Principle: [e.g., "Reuse over Buy over Build"]

**Description**: Prioritise reusing existing solutions, then buying commercial services, then building custom only as last resort

**Type**: Architecture Principle | Design Philosophy | Strategic Direction

**Rationale**:
- [Reduce technical debt and maintenance burden]
- [Faster time to market]
- [Focus engineering effort on business differentiation]

**Application**:
1. **First**: Check if existing internal platforms can be extended
   - [List internal platforms, e.g., "Enterprise API Gateway, Shared Auth Service"]
   - [Who to contact, e.g., "Platform team via #platform-requests Slack"]
2. **Second**: Evaluate commercial SaaS/PaaS offerings
   - [Approval process, e.g., "Procurement review required for >$5K/year"]
   - [Evaluation criteria, e.g., "Security certification, SLA, cost"]
3. **Third**: Build custom (requires justification)
   - [What justification needed, e.g., "Cost/benefit analysis, 3-year TCO comparison"]
   - [Who approves, e.g., "Architecture Review Board"]

**Flexibility**: Moderate
- [Can build if justified with data]
- [Can buy if internal platform doesn't meet needs]
- [Must document decision rationale in ADR (Architecture Decision Record)]

**Examples**:
```
✅ Good: "Evaluated internal auth service. Doesn't support MFA. Evaluated Okta ($15K/year) vs Auth0 ($12K/year). Recommend Okta (already approved vendor)."

✅ Good: "Need message queue. Internal messaging platform supports our use case. Using that."

❌ Bad: "Building custom message queue for learning purposes."

❌ Bad: "Using Auth0 without checking if internal auth service can be extended."
```

---

#### Principle: [Secure by Design]

**Description**: Security is built into every layer from the start, not added as an afterthought

**Type**: Architecture Principle | Security Philosophy | Non-Negotiable Standard

**Core Principles**:

**1. Design for Zero Secrets (Preferred Approach)**
- ✅ **PREFER** identity-based authentication with NO secrets at all
- ✅ Use OIDC (OpenID Connect) federation for cloud access
- ✅ Use Workload Identity/Managed Identity for service-to-service auth
- ✅ Use IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) in Kubernetes
- **Why**: No secrets means nothing to leak, rotate, or access control
- **Examples**:
  - GitHub Actions → Azure: OIDC federation (no Azure Client Secret)
  - AWS EKS → AWS services: IRSA (no access keys)
  - GKE → GCP services: Workload Identity (no service account keys)
  - Azure services → Azure services: Managed Identity (no passwords)
  - Kubernetes → Cloud APIs: Workload Identity Federation
- **Benefits**: Zero secrets to manage, no rotation needed, no risk of unauthorised access to secret stores

**2. Use Secret Managers (Fallback Only)**
- ⚠️ **ONLY** when identity-based auth isn't available (legacy systems, third-party APIs requiring API keys)
- ✅ Use AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault
- ✅ Rotate credentials regularly (90 days max)
- ✅ Use short-lived tokens with automatic expiration
- **Limitation**: Secret managers can be accessed by various people with permissions - prefer zero secrets approach

**3. Never Hardcode or Commit Secrets**
- ❌ **NEVER** hardcode secrets in code, config files, or environment variables in repos
- ❌ **NEVER** commit API keys, passwords, tokens, certificates to version control
- ❌ **NEVER** log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII, credit cards)

**2. Principle of Least Privilege**
- Grant minimum permissions needed (no admin/root unless absolutely required)
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) with specific roles
- Service accounts with narrow scopes only
- Regularly audit and remove unused permissions

**3. Defense in Depth**
- Multiple layers of security (network, application, data)
- Assume any layer can be breached
- Fail securely (deny by default, fail closed not open)

**4. Zero Trust Architecture**
- Never trust, always verify
- Verify explicitly (authenticate and authorise every request)
- Use least privilege access
- Assume breach (segment access, monitor everything)

**5. Input Validation & Output Encoding**
- Never trust user input (validate, sanitise, escape)
- Prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)
- Use parameterized queries, prepared statements
- Encode output based on context (HTML, JSON, URL)

**Implementation Requirements**:

**Authentication Architecture Decision Tree**:
```markdown
1. Can you use identity-based auth?
   ✅ YES → Use OIDC/Workload Identity/Managed Identity (ZERO SECRETS)
   ❌ NO → Go to step 2

2. Is this a third-party API that only supports API keys?
   ✅ YES → Use secret manager (FALLBACK)
   ❌ NO → Re-evaluate step 1, there's likely an identity-based option

3. Still using passwords/keys/secrets?
   ⚠️ Document why identity-based auth isn't possible
   ⚠️ Plan migration to identity-based auth in future
```

**Code Examples - Zero Secrets Architecture**:

```yaml
# ✅ BEST: GitHub Actions → Azure (OIDC federation, no secrets)
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Azure Login
  uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    client-id: ${{ vars.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}        # Public, not a secret
    tenant-id: ${{ vars.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}        # Public, not a secret
    subscription-id: ${{ vars.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}  # Public, not a secret
    # NO CLIENT SECRET NEEDED - uses OIDC federation

# ❌ OLD WAY: Using Azure Client Secret (avoid this)
- name: Azure Login
  uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}  # Secret that can be compromised
```

```python
# ✅ BEST: AWS SDK with IAM Role (IRSA in EKS, no secrets)
import boto3

# No credentials needed - uses IAM role attached to pod/instance
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')  # Automatically uses IAM role
s3_client.upload_file('file.txt', 'my-bucket', 'file.txt')

# ❌ OLD WAY: Using access keys (avoid this)
s3_client = boto3.client(
    's3',
    aws_access_key_id='AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',      # Secret
    aws_secret_access_key='wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY'  # Secret
)
```

```python
# ✅ BEST: Azure SDK with Managed Identity (no secrets)
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

# No secrets needed - uses Managed Identity
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = SecretClient(vault_url="https://myvault.vault.azure.net/", credential=credential)

# ❌ OLD WAY: Using client secret (avoid this)
from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential
credential = ClientSecretCredential(
    tenant_id="tenant-id",
    client_id="client-id",
    client_secret="secret-value"  # Secret that can be accessed by people
)
```

```python
# ⚠️ FALLBACK: Third-party API with only API key support
# Only use secret manager when identity-based auth is NOT available

import boto3

# Fetch from secret manager (better than hardcoding, but not ideal)
secrets_client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
api_secret = secrets_client.get_secret_value(SecretId='prod/third-party-api-key')

# ❌ NEVER DO THIS - Hardcoded secrets
API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # WRONG!
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password123@host/db"  # WRONG!

# ❌ NEVER LOG SECRETS
logger.info(f"API key: {api_key}")  # WRONG!
logger.info(f"Password: {password}")  # WRONG!

# ✅ CORRECT - Log safely
logger.info("Third-party API connection established")  # No credentials
logger.info(f"User {user_id} authenticated")  # No password/token
```

**Security Checklist**:

**Authentication Architecture**:
- [ ] Prefer identity-based auth (OIDC, Workload Identity, Managed Identity, IAM Roles)
- [ ] Document why any secrets/API keys are necessary (when identity-based auth isn't available)
- [ ] Zero secrets for cloud provider access (GitHub Actions → Azure/AWS/GCP via OIDC)
- [ ] Zero secrets for service-to-service auth within cloud (Managed Identity, IRSA, Workload Identity)
- [ ] If using secrets: stored in secret management system (never in code/config)
- [ ] If using secrets: rotation automated (max 90 days)

**Secret Protection**:
- [ ] Secrets never logged (check all log statements)
- [ ] Secrets never in error messages (even in dev/staging)
- [ ] `.gitignore` includes `.env`, `secrets/`, credentials files
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks scan for secrets (git-secrets, trufflehog, gitleaks)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline fails if secrets detected in commits

**Application Security**:
- [ ] All database queries use parameterised queries (no string concatenation)
- [ ] All user input validated and sanitised
- [ ] All API endpoints have authentication and authorisation
- [ ] HTTPS everywhere (no HTTP, even in dev)
- [ ] Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- [ ] Rate limiting on all public endpoints
- [ ] Principle of least privilege for all service accounts

**DevSecOps**:
- [ ] Regular dependency updates (automated via Dependabot/Renovate)
- [ ] Security scanning in CI/CD (SAST, dependency scanning)
- [ ] Container image scanning (if using containers)
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning (Checkov, tfsec)

**Data Protection**:
```markdown
**Encryption**:
- At rest: All databases, S3 buckets, volumes encrypted
- In transit: HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all network traffic
- Keys: Managed by cloud provider KMS (never self-managed)

**Sensitive Data Handling**:
- PII: Encrypted at rest, access logged, GDPR compliance
- Passwords: Hashed with bcrypt/Argon2 (NEVER store plaintext)
- Credit cards: Never store (use Stripe, payment gateway handles it)
- Tokens: Short-lived (1 hour max), refresh token rotation
```

**Authentication & Authorisation**:
```markdown
**Authentication**:
- Use established protocols: OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML 2.0
- MFA enforced for admin/privileged access
- Password requirements: min 12 chars, complexity rules
- Account lockout after failed attempts (5 attempts → 15 min lockout)

**Authorisation**:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with defined roles
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for complex permissions
- API endpoints: Check both authentication AND authorisation
- Database: Row-level security for multi-tenant data
```

**Security Tools & Automation**:
```markdown
**Development**:
- Pre-commit hooks: git-secrets, trufflehog (detect secrets before commit)
- IDE plugins: Security linters (Semgrep, SonarLint)
- Dependency scanning: Dependabot, Snyk, npm audit

**CI/CD**:
- SAST: Static application security testing (Semgrep, CodeQL)
- Dependency scanning: Check for vulnerable dependencies
- Secret scanning: Fail build if secrets detected
- Container scanning: Scan Docker images (Trivy, Snyk)

**Runtime**:
- WAF: Web application firewall (AWS WAF, Cloudflare)
- RASP: Runtime application self-protection
- Intrusion detection: Monitor for attacks
- Security monitoring: SIEM (Splunk, DataDog Security)
```

**Incident Response**:
```markdown
**Preparation**:
- Security runbook documented
- Incident response team identified
- Contact list (security team, legal, PR)

**Detection**:
- Security alerts configured (failed auth, unusual traffic)
- Log aggregation and analysis (CloudWatch, DataDog)
- Intrusion detection system (IDS)

**Response**:
- Isolate affected systems
- Preserve evidence (logs, snapshots)
- Rotate all potentially compromised credentials
- Notify affected users (GDPR: 72 hours)
- Post-incident review and remediation
```

**Rationale**:
- Security breaches cost millions (data, reputation, legal penalties)
- Easier to build security in than bolt it on later
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC 2, PCI-DSS) mandate security
- Customer trust depends on protecting their data
- Security incidents can destroy businesses

**Impact on Design**:
- Architecture: Design for security from day one
- Code reviews: Security-focused reviews required
- Dependencies: Only use well-maintained, secure libraries
- Testing: Security testing (SAST, DAST, penetration testing)
- Deployment: Automated security checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring: Security monitoring and alerting required

**Flexibility**: None (non-negotiable)
- Security principles cannot be compromised for speed or convenience
- Security exceptions require executive approval + risk assessment

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
```markdown
❌ "We'll add security later" → No, security is foundational
❌ "It's just a dev/staging environment" → Still must be secure
❌ "We're too small to be targeted" → Automated attacks target everyone
❌ "The firewall protects us" → Defense in depth required
❌ "I'll just commit this API key temporarily" → Never, use .env.local
❌ "Logging the full request helps debugging" → Redact sensitive data first
❌ "admin/admin for local development is fine" → Use proper auth always
```

**Examples**:
```
✅ Good: "API keys stored in AWS Secrets Manager, fetched at startup, rotated every 90 days. Pre-commit hooks scan for secrets."

✅ Good: "All user input validated with Joi schema validation before processing. SQL queries use parameterised statements only."

✅ Good: "Database encrypted at rest (AES-256), TLS 1.3 for all traffic, passwords hashed with Argon2."

❌ Bad: "API keys in .env file committed to Git for convenience."

❌ Bad: "SQL query built with string concatenation: 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=' + user_input"

❌ Bad: "Logging full request body including passwords for debugging."

### 4. Existing Architecture & Technical Landscape

> **Purpose**: Document the existing systems, technologies, and architecture that constrain or inform design decisions.

#### Current Architecture

**Description**: [Overview of existing system architecture, if any]

**Type**: Greenfield | Brownfield | Hybrid | Legacy Modernisation

**Existing Systems**:
| System/Service | Purpose | Technology Stack | Status | Integration Points |
|---------------|---------|------------------|--------|-------------------|
| [System name] | [What it does] | [Tech used] | [Active/Legacy/Deprecated] | [How we integrate] |
| [Example: User Service] | User management & auth | Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis | Active | REST API, shared DB |
| [Example: Billing System] | Payment processing | Java, Oracle DB | Legacy (replacing 2027) | SOAP API (unreliable) |

**Existing Data Stores**:
- **Primary**: [e.g., "PostgreSQL 14 cluster (3 nodes, 500GB)"]
- **Cache**: [e.g., "Redis (shared with other services)"]
- **Analytics**: [e.g., "Snowflake data warehouse"]
- **Files**: [e.g., "S3 bucket (2TB of user uploads)"]

**Existing Infrastructure**:
- **Cloud**: [e.g., "AWS (99% of workloads)", "On-prem datacenter (legacy only)"]
- **Container Orchestration**: [e.g., "ECS Fargate", "Kubernetes 1.27", "None - VMs only"]
- **CI/CD**: [e.g., "GitHub Actions", "Jenkins (legacy)"]
- **Monitoring**: [e.g., "DataDog", "Prometheus + Grafana", "None yet"]

**Architecture Patterns in Use**:
- [e.g., "Monolithic Rails app (main product)"]
- [e.g., "Microservices for new features (5 services)"]
- [e.g., "Event-driven with SNS/SQS"]
- [e.g., "API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB"]

**Rationale for Documenting**:
- [Understand what already exists]
- [Identify integration points and dependencies]
- [Respect existing investment and knowledge]
- [Plan migration paths if needed]

**Impact on Design**:
- **Must integrate with**: [List systems that cannot be replaced]
- **Should leverage**: [Existing infrastructure/services we should use]
- **Can replace**: [Legacy systems scheduled for retirement]
- **Data migration needed**: [If moving from existing datastores]

**Technical Debt**:
- [Known issues with current architecture, e.g., "Billing SOAP API is slow and unreliable"]
- [Planned improvements, e.g., "Migrating to new billing service in Q3 2026"]
- [Workarounds needed, e.g., "Must cache billing API responses aggressively"]

**Migration Strategy** (if applicable):
- [ ] **Strangler Fig**: Gradually replace legacy system while it runs
- [ ] **Big Bang**: Full replacement in one deployment
- [ ] **API Facade**: Keep legacy, add modern interface
- [ ] **No Migration**: Build alongside existing systems

**Flexibility**: Varies by component
- [Some systems are untouchable (e.g., core billing)]
- [Some can be replaced if justified (e.g., old admin UI)]
- [Document which is which]

**Examples**:
```
✅ Good: "Current system uses PostgreSQL. New service will also use PostgreSQL for consistency and can share connection pooling infrastructure."

✅ Good: "Legacy billing API is unreliable. Will implement circuit breaker pattern and aggressive caching. Planning full replacement in Q3 2026."

❌ Bad: "Ignoring existing user service and building a new one without migration plan."

❌ Bad: "Proposed MongoDB for new feature when entire stack uses PostgreSQL (adds operational complexity)."
```

  - [e.g., "Multi-repo: company-name/service-name"]
- **Branch Protection**: [e.g., "Main/develop branches protected, PR reviews required"]
- **Access Control**: [e.g., "SSO via Okta, team-based permissions"]

**Rationale**:
- [Enterprise GitHub license already purchased]
- [Standardised across organisation for consistency]
- [Integration with CI/CD and security scanning tools]

**Impact on Design**:
- [Must use Git for version control]
- [Must follow GitFlow branching strategy]

| User guides | Confluence wiki | Confluence pages | End users |
| Runbooks | PagerDuty / Wiki | Markdown/Wiki | Operations team |
| Meeting notes | Confluence | Confluence pages | Stakeholders |

**Impact on Design**:
- [Must maintain design docs in repository alongside code]
- [Must generate API docs from code (OpenAPI annotations)]
- [Must keep docs up-to-date with code changes]
- [Must follow documentation templates and standards]

**Flexibility**: Low

- **User-Facing Content**: [e.g., "Australian English for AU users, US English for US users"]
- **Variable Naming**: [e.g., "Use Australian spelling in code (colour, initialise, organisation)"]

**Rationale**:
- [Consistency across all documentation and code]
- [Matches organisation's location and customer base (Australia)]
- [Aligns with brand voice and customer expectations]
- [Reduces confusion from mixed spelling (color vs colour)]

**Specific Requirements**:

**Spelling Standards**:
- ✅ **Use**: colour, initialise, organisation, centre, analyse, licence (noun)
- ❌ **Avoid**: color, initialize, organization, center, analyze, license (noun)

**Code Examples**:
```python
# ✅ Australian English in code
class UserOrganisation:
    def initialise_colour_scheme(self):
        self.colour = "blue"
        self.centre_alignment = True

# ❌ US English (inconsistent with standard)
class UserOrganization:
    def initialize_color_scheme(self):
        self.color = "blue"
        self.center_alignment = True
```

**Documentation Standards**:
- **Technical docs**: Australian English spelling
- **Code comments**: Australian English spelling
- **API documentation**: Australian English for field names and descriptions
- **Error messages**: Australian English phrasing
- **User interface text**: Australian English

**Date & Time Formats**:
- **Date format**: [e.g., "DD/MM/YYYY (31/01/2026)" for Australian, "MM/DD/YYYY" for US]
- **Time format**: [e.g., "24-hour (14:30)" or "12-hour (2:30 PM)"]
- **Timezone**: [e.g., "AEST/AEDT (Australia/Sydney)", "UTC", "User's local timezone"]

**Number Formats**:
- **Decimal separator**: [e.g., "Period/full stop (1,234.56)" or "Comma (1.234,56)"]
- **Thousand separator**: [e.g., "Comma (1,234.56)" or "Space (1 234.56)"]
- **Currency**: [e.g., "AUD ($1,234.56)", "USD ($1,234.56)", "EUR (€1.234,56)"]

**Impact on Design**:
- [All developers must use Australian English in code and docs]
- [Code linters should check spelling (e.g., codespell with en-AU dictionary)]
- [UI components must format dates/times according to locale]
- [APIs must accept and return localised date/time formats]
- [Translation strategy if multi-language support needed later]

**Tools & Enforcement**:
- **Spell checker**: [e.g., "VS Code with Australian English dictionary"]
- **Linter**: [e.g., "codespell configured for en-AU"]
- **Style guide**: [e.g., "Link to organisation's style guide"]
- **PR reviews**: [e.g., "Reviewers check for language consistency"]

**Flexibility**: Low (organisational standard)
- [Exception for technical terms that are always US English (e.g., "color" in CSS/HTML)]
- [Exception for third-party library names and APIs (use their naming)]

**Common Exceptions**:
```
✅ Technical terms that remain US English:
- CSS properties: color, center, gray (not colour, centre, grey)
- HTML attributes: color, center
- Library names: tensorflow, colorama (use their spelling)

✅ Australian English everywhere else:
- Variable names: user_colour, initialise_app(), organisation_settings
- Documentation: "The colour picker initialises on page load"
- Comments: "Initialise the organisation's colour scheme"
```

**Examples**:
```
✅ Good (Consistent Australian English):
"The application initialises the user's colour preferences from their organisation settings."

Variable: user_colour_scheme
Function: initialise_organisation()
Comment: # Initialise colour values for the organisation

❌ Bad (Mixed US/Australian English):
"The application initializes the user's color preferences from their organisation settings."

Variable: user_color_scheme (US)
Function: initialise_organization() (mixed)
Comment: # Initialize colour values for the organization (mixed)
```

**Verification**:
- [Code review checks for language consistency]
- [Automated spell checking in CI/CD pipeline]
- [Style guide compliance verification]

### 6. Budget & Resource Constraints

#### Guardrail: [Budget Cap]

**Description**: Total project budget capped at $100,000

**Type**: Budget Constraint | Financial Limit

**Breakdown**:
- Infrastructure: [$30K/year]
- Development: [$50K (contractor costs)]
- SaaS/Licenses: [$10K/year]
- Contingency: [$10K]

**Rationale**:
- [Approved budget allocation for fiscal year]
- [ROI target: break even within 18 months]

**Impact on Design**:
- [Must optimise for cost - prefer PaaS over IaaS]
- [Must size infrastructure conservatively]
- [Must evaluate build vs buy carefully]
- [Must consider open-source alternatives]

**Flexibility**: Limited
- [Can request additional $25K with business case]
- [Requires VP approval + 4-week process]
- [Rarely approved unless critical]

**Cost Monitoring**:
- Monthly review: [Project manager tracks actual vs budget]
- Alerts: [Notify if trending >10% over budget]

---

#### Guardrail: [Timeline Deadline]

**Description**: Must launch by June 30, 2026

**Type**: Fixed Deadline | Regulatory Requirement | Business Commitment

**Rationale**:
- [New data protection law takes effect July 1, 2026]
- [System must be compliant before law is active]
- [Penalties for non-compliance: fines + legal liability]

**Milestones**:
| Date | Milestone | Criticality |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Feb 28, 2026 | Architecture approved | High |
| Apr 30, 2026 | Core features complete | High |
| May 31, 2026 | Testing & security review complete | Critical |
| Jun 15, 2026 | Deployment to production | Critical |
| Jun 30, 2026 | Launch | Absolute |

**Impact on Design**:
- [Scope must be ruthlessly prioritised]
- [MVP-first approach required]
- [May need to defer nice-to-have features to Phase 2]
- [Technical debt acceptable if contained]

**Flexibility**: None (regulatory deadline)

**Contingency**:
- [If at risk, must escalate by Apr 1, 2026]
- [Options: reduce scope, increase team, accept penalties]

### 7. Team Capacity & Capability

> **Purpose**: Document who is doing the work and what constraints that creates.

#### Guardrail: [Team Composition & Capacity]

**Description**: [Describe who is building this - solo developer, small team, large organisation, etc.]

**Type**: Resource Constraint | Capacity Limitation | Skills Constraint

**Current Capacity**:

*Choose the scenario that applies:*

**Scenario 1: Solo Developer / Building It Yourself**
- **You**: [Your role, e.g., "Full-stack developer", "Technical founder", "Product engineer"]
- **Availability**: [e.g., "20 hours/week (nights & weekends)", "Full-time", "50% of time (other projects too)"]
- **Your Skills**:
  - Strong: [e.g., "React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS basics"]
  - Learning: [e.g., "TypeScript, Docker"]
  - Weak/Avoid: [e.g., "Kubernetes, distributed systems, DevOps"]
- **Support Available**: [e.g., "Can ask CTO for architecture review", "Have DevOps consultant on retainer (5 hrs/month)", "None - solo"]

**Scenario 2: Small Team (2-5 people)**
- **Team Size**: [e.g., "3 developers"]
- **Team Composition**:
  - Backend: [e.g., "1 senior developer (you)"]
  - Frontend: [e.g., "1 mid-level developer"]
  - Full-stack: [e.g., "1 junior developer"]
- **Collective Skills**:
  - Strong: [Python, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL]
  - Moderate: [Azure, Docker, CI/CD]
  - Weak: [Kubernetes, service mesh, distributed systems]
- **Contractors/Support**: [e.g., "Can hire contractors for < 3 months", "DevOps team provides infrastructure support"]

**Scenario 3: Established Team**
- **Team Size**: [e.g., "12 engineers across 3 squads"]
- **Specialisations**: [e.g., "Backend squad (4), Frontend squad (4), Platform squad (4)"]
- **Support Functions**: [e.g., "Dedicated DevOps (2), QA (3), Security (shared)"]
- **Skills**: [Document team-wide capabilities]

**Rationale for Guardrails**:
- [Budget constraints - cannot hire]
- [Timeline - working solo means slower delivery]
- [Skills gaps - team needs to learn new tech]
- [Availability - part-time work only]

**Impact on Design**:
- **Operational Complexity**: [Must limit to what team can manage, e.g., "Avoid Kubernetes if solo developer"]
- **Technology Choices**: [Must match team skills, e.g., "Stick to Python since that's what we know"]
- **Scope**: [Must be realistic about what team can build, e.g., "Cannot build complex distributed system with 1 developer"]
- **Support Model**: [e.g., "Must use managed services since no ops team", "Need excellent documentation for junior devs"]
- **Pace**: [e.g., "Solo developer → expect 6 months not 2 months", "Small team → simpler architecture"]

**Growth Options** (if applicable):
- **Can grow**: [e.g., "Budget approved to hire 2 more devs in Q3"]
- **Contractors**: [e.g., "Can engage contractors for specific needs (< 3 months)"]
- **Training**: [e.g., "Budget available for courses/certifications"]
- **Cannot grow**: [e.g., "Hiring freeze - team size is fixed"]

**Flexibility**: [None | Limited | Moderate]
- [Document what's possible vs what's not]

---

#### Guardrail: [Required Process/Team Involvement]

**Description**: Security team must review before production deployment

**Type**: Process Requirement | Governance Policy

**Process**:
1. Submit security review request 3 weeks before planned deployment
2. Provide: threat model, data flow diagrams, auth/authz design
3. Security team reviews within 2 weeks
4. Address any findings
5. Get sign-off

**Rationale**:
- [Risk management policy]
- [Required for insurance coverage]
- [SOC 2 compliance requirement]

**Impact on Timeline**:
- [Add 3-week buffer to deployment timeline]
- [Can get preliminary feedback early (recommended)]
- [Critical/high findings may block deployment]

**Flexibility**: None (required by policy)

**Best Practice**:
- [Engage security team early for design review]
- [Schedule formal review 4-5 weeks before launch]
- [Have contingency plan for findings]

---

## Flexible Preferences (Not Guardrails)

These are preferences that can be challenged with data/rationale:

### Preference: [e.g., "Would prefer microservices"]

**Type**: Architectural Preference

**Rationale**: [e.g., "Modern approach, perceived scalability benefits"]

**Flexibility**: ⭐⭐⭐ FULLY OPEN TO CHALLENGE
- [This is aspirational, not required]
- [Alternative approaches acceptable if justified]
- [Decision should be based on team size, complexity, scale]

**Challenge Welcome**: Yes - please research and recommend best approach for context

---

### Preference: [e.g., "Would like to use GraphQL"]

**Type**: Technology Preference

**Rationale**: [e.g., "Developer interest, learning opportunity"]

**Flexibility**: ⭐⭐ OPEN TO DISCUSSION
- [Not required, but team would like to try]
- [REST is acceptable alternative]
- [Recommend approach based on requirements]

**Challenge Welcome**: Yes — analyse trade-offs and recommend

## How to Work with These Guardrails

### Respect Absolute Guardrails
✅ **Do**:
- Accept platform mandates (Azure vs AWS)
- Follow architecture principles (Reuse > Buy > Build)
- Meet compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC 2)
- Work within budget caps and timelines
- Involve required teams (Security review)

❌ **Don't**:
- Suggest technologies outside approved list
- Propose solutions that violate compliance
- Ignore budget or timeline constraints
- Skip required processes or reviews

### Work Creatively Within Guardrails
Examples:
- "Since Azure is required, let's use Azure Container Apps instead of Kubernetes"
- "To meet budget, let's use PaaS services instead of building infrastructure"
- "Given timeline, let's defer feature X to Phase 2 and focus on compliance"
- "Since team is small, let's use managed services to minimise operational burden"

### Challenge Gently When Appropriate
When to challenge (respectfully):
- Guardrail seems to contradict other guardrails
- Guardrail has major cost/complexity implications
- Guardrail lacks clear rationale
- Better alternative exists that meets same goals

How to challenge:
```
"I understand [guardrail]. I researched [alternatives] and found [option] achieves
the same goal with [benefits]. Given [context], would you be open to [alternative]?

If not, I'll work within the guardrail and optimise accordingly."
```
