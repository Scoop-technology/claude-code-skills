# Requirements Gathering Guide

This guide provides a structured approach to gathering requirements through progressive questioning. Don't ask all questions at once—adapt to the conversation flow and the user's context.

## Phase 1: Project Context & Vision

### 1.1 Problem Understanding

**Core Questions:**
- What problem are we trying to solve?
- Who is experiencing this problem?

**Probing Questions:**
- Can you describe a specific example or scenario where this problem occurs?
- How frequently does this problem occur?
- Are there specific pain points that stand out?

**What to Listen For:**

## Tips for Effective Requirements Gathering

### 1. Progressive Questioning
- Start broad, then drill down
- Don't ask all questions in one session
- Adapt questions based on answers
- Follow interesting threads

### 2. Use Examples
- Ask for specific examples or scenarios
- Request to see existing systems or workarounds
- Use "show me" rather than "tell me"

### 3. Paraphrase and Confirm
- Restate requirements in your own words
- Confirm understanding before moving on
- Document and share notes for validation

### 4. Explore the "Why"
- Ask "why" multiple times to get to root causes
- Understand the motivation behind each requirement
- Challenge assumptions respectfully

### 5. Identify Gaps
- Look for missing user groups
- Find unmentioned failure scenarios
- Identify integration points not discussed
- Spot security or compliance oversights

### 6. Use Collaborative Tools
- AskUserQuestion tool for key decisions
- Sketching/diagramming (describe what you'd draw)
- Reviewing existing code/documentation

### 7. Prioritise Ruthlessly
- Use MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
- Validate priorities against goals
- Challenge "must haves" that aren't critical

### 8. Document Assumptions
- Explicitly state what you're assuming
- Get confirmation on assumptions
- Track which assumptions need validation
